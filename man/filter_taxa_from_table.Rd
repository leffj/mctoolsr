\title{Filter taxa from an individual taxa summary table}
\usage{
filter_taxa_from_table(tax_table, filter_thresh, taxa_to_keep, taxa_to_remove)
}
\arguments{
\item{tax_table}{Input taxa summary table from
\code{\link{summarize_taxonomy}} (dataframe).}

\item{filter_thresh}{Filter taxa less than this number based on mean table
values.}

\item{taxa_to_keep}{Keep only taxa that contain these names. Vector or
string.}

\item{taxa_to_remove}{Remove taxa that contain these names. Vector or string.}
}
\description{
Can use one or more of the parameters to do filtering. Threshold 
  filtering takes precidence over taxa filtering. If taxa to keep and taxa to
  remove are both included, taxa to remove will be removed if the parameter
  entries conflict. Note that taxa string matching uses grep, so you can
  provide partial taxa strings. However, if there are multiple matches, all
  matching taxa will be removed.
