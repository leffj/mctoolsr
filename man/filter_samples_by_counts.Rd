\title{Filter samples from a dataset based on number of sequences}
\usage{
filter_samples_by_counts(input, min_seqs)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{The input dataset as loaded by \code{\link{load_taxa_table}}.}

\item{min_seqs}{A sample must have at minimum this number of sequences in
order to be retained.}
}
\value{
A list variable with (1) the loaded taxa table, (2) the loaded 
  mapping file, and optionally (3) the loaded taxonomy information.
}
\description{
This function is useful for removing samples that have a low
  number of sequences.
}
\examples{
# see number of sequences per sample
sort(colSums(fruits_veggies$data_loaded))
# remove samples with less than 1100 sequences
filter_samples_by_counts(fruits_veggies, min_seqs = 1100)
