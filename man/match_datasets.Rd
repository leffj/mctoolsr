\title{Match up samples from two datasets}
\usage{
match_datasets(ds1, ds2, match_taxa = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{ds1}{The first dataset as loaded by \code{\link{load_taxa_table}}.}

\item{ds2}{The second dataset.}

\item{match_taxa}{[OPTIONAL] Do you want to match taxa in addition to sample 
IDs? If \code{TRUE}, taxa will be removed if they are not in common between
datasets. Default = \code{FALSE}}
}
\value{
A list variable with the matched ds1 as the first element and ds2 as 
  the second element.
}
\description{
Function to match up sample order and optionally,  taxa order 
  from two datasets that contain some overlapping sample IDs. Sample IDs that
  are not present in both datasets will be dropped. The output is a list 
  containing the two filtered datasets in the same order as they were input.
}
\examples{
# This function would normally be run with two different datasets not the
# same one as in this example. For example if you had bacterial and fungal
# data for the same samples and wanted to compare the two.
