\title{Filter samples from dissimilarity matrix}
\usage{
filter_dm(input_dm, filter_cat, filter_vals, keep_vals)
}
\arguments{
\item{input_dm}{The input dissimilarity matrix with corresponding mapping 
file as generated by \code{\link{load_dm}} or
\code{\link{calc_mean_dissimilarities}} with the option to produce a
resulting metadata map.}

\item{filter_cat}{The metadata map header string for the factor you would 
like to use to filter samples.}

\item{filter_vals}{The values within the filter category (vector or single 
value) you would like to use to remove samples from the dissimilarity 
matrix and metadata map.}

\item{keep_vals}{Alternatively, keep only samples represented by these 
values.}
}
\value{
A list variable with (1) the loaded dissimilarity matrix and (2) the 
  loaded mapping file.
}
\description{
Filter out or keep particular samples in a dissimilarity matrix 
  based on contextual metadata.
}
\examples{
# rarefy
fruits_veggies_rar = single_rarefy(fruits_veggies, 1000)
# calculate dissimilarities
dm = calc_dm(fruits_veggies_rar$data_loaded)
# calculated mean dissimilarities by sample type
dm_means = calc_mean_dissimilarities(dm = dm,
                                     metadata_map = fruits_veggies$map_loaded,
                                     summarize_by_factor = 'Sample_type',
                                     return_map = TRUE)
# filter sample types to include only lettuce and spinach
filter_dm(input_dm = dm_means, filter_cat = 'Sample_type',
          keep_vals = c('Lettuce', 'Spinach'))
