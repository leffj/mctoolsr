\title{Calculate the proportion of taxa in a set of samples that are
 also observed in another sample type}
\usage{
calc_prop_taxa_from_sample_type(
  input,
  type_header,
  primary_type,
  source_type,
  within_cat
)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{The input dataset as loaded by \code{\link{load_taxa_table}}.}

\item{type_header}{The header label from the metadata map that has the
labels which indicate the types of samples you want to use.}

\item{primary_type}{The sample type for which you would like to calculate
the proportion of taxa that are also observed in the \code{source_type}.}

\item{source_type}{The sample type to use as the source type.}

\item{within_cat}{[OPTIONAL] Specify a header label from the metadata map
that tells the function to restrict pairs to within levels of this factor. 
If included, will return a data frame instead of a vector.}
}
\description{
Calculate the mean proportion of taxa (i.e. OTUs) in a set of
  samples that are also observed in another sample type. One use of this
  function is to get a rough sense of how likely a potential source is
  contributing to the compostion of another sample type.

# proportion of taxa on strawberries that were also found on spinach within
