Description: This package is intended to aid molecular microbial community
    data analysis. Several bioinformatic pipelines (e.g., UPARSE, MOTHUR, QIIME,
    etc.) take marker gene (e.g., 16S rRNA, fungal ITS, etc) sequences as input and
    produce taxa tables (i.e. OTU tables). mctoolsr is designed to perform common
    (and less common) exploratory analyses and build plots with these data. The goal
    is to simplify repetative tasks in R and to easily integrate with R code that
    you have already developed or will develop in the future.
